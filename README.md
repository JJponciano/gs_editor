# Editor
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JJponciano/gs_editor
cd supersplat
npm i
npm run develop
```

The last command `npm run develop` will build and run a local version of the editor on port 3000. Changes to the source are detected and the editor is automatically rebuilt.

To access the local editor instance, open a browser tab and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
